    "**The columns in the mushrooms dataset seem to be correlated**. We suspect this because many columns seem to have dependencies. For example, if `ring-number` is `n` (none), `ring-type` must be `n` (none) too. Only when `ring-number` is `o` (one) or `t` (two) `ring-type` can be values other than `n`. Other columns may have inter-dependencies too but we can't tell right now. \n",

    "Why are we concerned about the variable correlations (also called *multicollinearity*)? It's because if they are strongly correlated, we shouldn't use the linear regression algorithm as the machine learning model. The prediction of the linear regression model is known to be unstable and inaccurate if the variables are strongly correlated. You can read more about why [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity#Consequences_of_multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "So far it's just our suspicion that the variables are strongly correlated. We need to verify that. Since all the columns are categorical, we cannot use a correlation matrix to examine the degrees of correlations. There are several ways to test whether categorical variables are correlated. The first way is to convert the categorical values to ordinal, then calculate the correlation matrix with the numerical values. The second way is to use a [Chi-Square test of independence](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat500/node/56/) to find out whether there is correlation between each pair of variables. We will use the second way in this lab. So read the explanation of Chi-Square test of independence to understand what it does.\n",

Our **null hypothesis of the Chi-Square test of independence is that the two variables are independent** and the **alternative hypothesis is that they are not independent**. To perform Chi-Squre test of independence, we first create a contingency table of those two features using Pandas' [`crosstab`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.crosstab.html) function, then use Scipy's [`chi2_contingency`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html) to test the variable independence from the contingency table.\n",
